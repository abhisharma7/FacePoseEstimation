# Face Pose Estimation

Human pose recognition in a ideal case is divided into two steps, known as human detection and human pose recognition and they are usually considered separately. There is an extensive literature in both detection and recognition but relatively few research consider the two stages together. In this project, I have targeted to recognize the human face pose using numerous algorithms and frameworks.
